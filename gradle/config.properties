# Gradle JDK Configuration
# This file defines the Java home for Gradle when using #GRADLE_LOCAL_JAVA_HOME macro
# The path should point to the JDK installation directory

# For Android Studio, this typically uses the JetBrains Runtime (JBR) that comes with the IDE
# You can find the JBR path in: File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JDK
# Or use a system JDK path if installed separately

# Uncomment and set the path to your JDK installation:
# java.home=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17

# Alternative: Use the Android Studio bundled JDK (typically in Android Studio installation folder)
# Example: java.home=C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr

# Note: If using #GRADLE_LOCAL_JAVA_HOME macro in gradle.xml, you must set java.home here
# Otherwise, Android Studio will fall back to the Project JDK
